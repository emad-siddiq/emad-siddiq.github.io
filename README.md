This is my personal blog that came about out of an unsatisfactory experience working in Next.js for my previous blog and an unwillingness to pay AWS every month for a static IP. Using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
I can deploy my website for free by pushing to this repo.

You can find template blog code from this website [here](https://github.com/emad-siddiq/emad-siddiq.github.io/tree/main/static/html/blogs/template).


My old Next.js website can be found [here](https://github.com/emad-siddiq/personal_website).
