    <h1> The C Programming Language P1.</h1>

    <p> 
        The C Programming Language is probably the greatest invention of the 20th century. 
        The fact that the language is actively used 50 years since its inception and remains relatively 
        unchanged is a testament to its great design. It's also a lucky co-occurence that all programming languages in existence are influenced by C.

    <p> 
        Before we get started, we need a compiler that turns our code into a machine-understandable binary file.
        We are going to use <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/">GNU GCC.</a> for this purpose. 
        You can install this on any Linux installation with: </p>

 <code>
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code>

    <p> And: </p>
        <code> brew install gcc </code>
        <p>on Mac. </p>
        
    <p>Windows users can follow <a href="https://medium.com/@_arupbasak_/setup-c-c-compiler-easiest-way-470db3f1000c"> this tutorial</a>. 

    <p> 
        In these tutorials, I'll mainly work through the questions in the K & R book.

<code> 
#include <stdio.h> 

int main() {
    printf("Hello World!");
}   
</code>
